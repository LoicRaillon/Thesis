The PhD thesis is accessible at: *link* 

All the code used in the thesis are written in MATLAB (R2017.b) and are available here.

Details are given inside the main functions and sub-functions.

**Chapter 2:** 
  - Run MAIN.m to obtain the results of the chapter 2.
  
**Chapter 3:**  
  - Run sim_M1_profile_M1_M2.m to obtain the results of the section 3.3.1. The results are also saved in M1_M2_profile_v2.mat.
  - Run sim_M7_profile_M6.m to obtain the results of the section 3.3.2. The results are also saved in M7_M6_profile.mat.
  
**Chapter 4:**
  - Run MH_M3_5alpha.m to obtain the results of the section 4.3 with the model M3.
  - Run MH_M4_5alpha.m to obtain the results of the section 4.3 with the model M4.
  - Run results_Table_4_5.m to obtain the results in Table 4.5.
  - Run Profile_ML_MAP_M3.m to compute the profiles in Figure 4.9.
  All the figures and tables of the chapter 4 can be obtained by running the scripts in the folder "results".
  
**Chapter 5:**
  - Run MC_simulations.m to obtain the results of the section 5.4. The results are saved in MC_simu.mat and can be plotted with plot_MC_simulations.m
  - Run TH_proposed.m to obtain the results of the section 5.5. The results are saved in TH_proposed_data.mat and can be plotted with Plot_TH_proposed.m
  
**Appendix 4:**
  - Run frequentist_model_selection.m to obtain the results of the section 4.6.1. 
  
**Appendix 5:**
  - Run illustration_PF.m to plot the Figure 5.14
